  abstract  = {Where feature points are used in real-time frame-rate applications, a high-speed feature detector is necessary. Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7{\%} of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120{\%}) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300{\%}) can operate at full frame rate.},
