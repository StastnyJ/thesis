\section{2-stage view matching}

This approach tries to combine both previously presented methods to achieve better results. The first approach works pretty well in many scenes but has one drawback. Since the objects' shapes are mainly ignored, taking into account only the ratio between the volume and the area of the objects, there could be many scenes with similarly placed objects with similar sizes but different shapes. This could lead to many unwanted false positive evaluations. This approach tries to use neural networks presented in section [TODO section ref] to eliminate these false negatives while maintaining most of the advantages of the first approach, described in section [TODO section ref].\par
