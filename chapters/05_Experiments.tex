\chapter{Experiments}\label{chapter:experiments}

In this section, all presented algorithms will be tested using different metrics and compared with the visual place recognition used in the original RatSLAM approach, described in section \ref{section:ratSlamRW}. The beginning of the chapter will introduce the robot simulator and the environments used for the tests. The following section formally defines the evaluation metrics. The next section will present the system setup of the experiments. In the following four sections, the results of the different evaluation metrics will be discussed. In the penultimate section will be tested the integration of the place recognition approaches with RatSLAM. Finally, the last section will summarize all measured results and discuss the final performance and advantages or disadvantages of all suggested techniques.
