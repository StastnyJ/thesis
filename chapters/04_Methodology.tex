\chapter{Methodology}\label{chapter:methodology}

This chapter provides a detailed description of all the algorithms and techniques implemented in this work. At the beginning of this chapter, the problem is precisely defined. The following section describes a basic system overview with all used components and descriptions\par
In this thesis, we are mainly solving two problems: data fusion and scene recognition. The approach to solving the data-fusion is described in the third section. The rest of the chapter describes three methods for solving scene recognition problems.\par
Furthermore, the second section also presents how to connect the data fusion and scene recognition algorithm to the RatSLAM ROS to solve the SLAM problem.
